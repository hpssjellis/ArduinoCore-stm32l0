*
* For farthest LoRa sending max at 11 BYTES or 88 bits
* Thats 11 letters perfect enough to send Machine Learning Coded information
* or 88 bits if you want to Hexadecimal exchange data.  
*
* 1. I want to send data from a node and then wait for a confirmation
* The confirmation can then effect the next data send
*
* 2. If no confirmation I want the node to try again but with
* a stronger signal etc
* If still no reply I want to connect to 
* TTN (TheThingsNetwork) first if no connection then
* Helium.org next
*
* Presntly working on getting a confirmation response.
